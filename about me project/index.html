       Thanks for your interest, here is a quick story of me and this website.
       <hr> I am working as a Business Analyst and want to be a professor one day.
      I have my goals set that i want to do MBA from a renowned institute in India and PHD from one of the best universities of the world (best in terms of knowledge).
      
      I wish to lecture (:P) students in a university in the day and own a little cafe where i can cook and bake for the rest of the day. I want to be a dietician too and want to work from my cafe. I know this is too much but i know i will achieve it one day, sooner or later.
      
      This was all about what i want to achieve from career perspective and you can tell i am ambitious.
      
      I am a responsible person. I can handle a home very well. I can say that as i have been living alone in a flat since more than 6 years now and after my father passed away i have been looking after my family.
      
      I am a good dresser. My style is comfortable clothes but chic and sexy at times.
      
      Will let the pictures speak.
      <hr>
      I am very much into self help and psychological books. I cannot call it a day until i have read something good.
      
      I am mindful of everything. I dont just see things, i SEE things. If you are confused that what does that mean, it is about not just looking at the thing but looking mindfully. When i see a gate, i see the wood the paint the workers who made it and the other stuff.
      
      I love eating healthy food. I am not into counting calories but i eat healthy 30 days a month. It can be as simple as a banana or as complex as a buddha bowl.
      
      I cannot work out. My body and mind is never motivated for working out in a gym. I have no routine of what i do daily in terms of exercise. I have paid money in gyms multiple time and went only for the initial week or so. Later up i stopped resisting the feeling that i can’t gym and accepted it. Now, i do yoga, walk, jog, dance or whatever i feel like doing and it has given me better results than gym.
      
      I am in a happy relationship. I am proud and glad to have found him. I was the one to propose and he agreed.
      
      I understand myself better than i did 3 months back. I constantly keep on analysing my thoughts, feelings and patterns. This has helped me understand myself better. I no more blame other people or situation for how i feel. I take full ownership of myself. I love myself more every single day due to that.
      <hr>
      I do not intake negativity. I stay away from all sort of negativity. If i know a certain movie have upsetting content, i will not watch it. I mostly stick to watching Friends on repeat and it has never failed me. I do not watch TV or anything on the weekdays.
      
      Its very difficult for me to make friends. I am very talkative and i can talk with you for hours after we are friends but i find it very difficult to talk to strangers. I find it very awkward and say all sort of bulshit out of nervousness.
      
      I am a counsellor for people going through tough phase of life. I had mixed anxiety depressive disorder and hence how what it feels like. Now, i counsel people. So if you looking for help, DM me.
      
      I am unapologetically myself. I have learnt to forgive myself. Thrashing myself doesn’t help but learning from the situation does.
      
      I love being out in nature. It somehow makes me feel relaxed. It is miraculous.
                        <hr>
        
                        I do my work mainly in html,
                        Css and JavaScript. these I know Web Development and database as well.
                        <hr>
        
                        This website is basically one of my
                        Web Development project which is
                        built using HTML only.
                        Here one can also find ideas for
                        projects in different languages.
        
                        Thanks again for reading this,
                        because of people like you, it
                        exists and prospers!
